      <p>
        I'm a front-end developer from Denmark but currently living in
        Argentina. I have a serious passion for front-end development.
        Well-organised, self-driven, and love to solve problems. Fan of outdoor
        activities, travelling, movies and languages. I am interested in the entire front-end space and
        working on projects with people from all around the world.
